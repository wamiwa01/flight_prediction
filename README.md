## Summary of Findings

After analyzing this data, we found that the highest cause of delays came from the carrier or weather related problems. American Airlines was the worst performing carrier with highest delays and cancellations from 2006 to 2008.

This analysis further supports the finding that weather conditions were the top reasons for delays. It can also be seen that longer flights with longer distances experience longer arrival (average) delays than shorter flights.




## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, i focused on the cause of delay and its reason. The plots shown in the presentation were chosen such that we can follow the story of delays and cancellations at the same time and compare them. Since carrier performance can be gauged in terms of both these metric, they have been explored and highlighed in the presentation.
